<h1>So, you did not win $1.6 Billion US Powerball Jackpot</h1>
  <p>What will you do if you’re one of the winners? Do you think previous winners asked the same questions? Have you ever asked what happened to previous lottery winners? Where do you think they are in their life right now?
                Is winning a lottery a Blessing or a Curse? Is sudden wealth or get-rich-quickly your dream? What does God has to say about gambling, lottery and handling money?<br>
                “The wise man saves for the future, but the foolish man spends whatever he gets.” – Proverbs 21:20, TLB<br>
                There are four things that are small but unusually wise:<br>
                Ants: they aren’t strong, but store up food for the winter.<br> 
                Cliff badgers: delicate little animals who protect themselves by living among the rocks.<br> 
                The locusts: though they have no leader, they stay together in swarms.<br> 
                The lizards: they are easy to catch and kill, yet are found even in king’s palaces! – Proverbs 30:24-25, TLB</p>
