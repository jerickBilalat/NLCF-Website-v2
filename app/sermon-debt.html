  <p>My WORK: Is it a Blessing or a Burden?
What can we do to find SATISFACTION in our WORK? Working can be a very positive part of your life, or it can be draining. If we gain God’s perspective on work, it will become a BLESSING. What Scripture teaches about work? <br>Exodus 34:21: “Six days you shall labor” <br>2 Thessalonians 3:10: “if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either”<br>
Why does work matter so much?<br> One answer is that work DEVELOPS our CHARACTER. They refine our thinking processes, and teach discipline. A job is not just a task to earn money; it is also intended to produce godly character in the life of the worker.
All HONEST JOBS are equally HONORABLE. There is PRIDE and DIGNITY in all types of work. Scripture does not elevate any honest profession above another.</p>
