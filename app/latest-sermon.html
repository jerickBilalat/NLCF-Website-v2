  <p><b>TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT MONEY, Why Me?</b><br><br>
      “TRAIN UP a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.” – Proverbs 22:6, NKJV<br><br>
      “Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall TEACH them to your CHILDREN, SPEAKING of them when you SIT in your house, when you WALK by the way, when you LIE DOWN, and when you RISE UP.” – Deuteronomy 11:18-19, NASB<br><br>
      How well prepared were you to make financial decisions when you left home? 1) Would you agree that learning to handle money is part of our children’s education? 2) Would you also agree that most parents spend 18 to 22 years preparing their kids for occupations but generally less than few hours teaching children the value and use of money?<br><br>
      Most children have not been taught God’s Way of handling money. As an unfortunate consequence, children leave home ill equip to mange their financial future. I believe we have the responsibility to leave their children the legacy of understanding and applying God’s financial principles.<br><br>
      This Sunday’s message "TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT MONEY" is designed to instruct and help us train our children to earn and manage money from biblical perspective.
