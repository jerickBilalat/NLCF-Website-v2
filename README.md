## NLCF Church Website
**Goal:**For over two years developing the NLCF website, it has been my largest project because the process of making the static websites and publishing it involved not just coding but also content management, design, and some seo. All these work are necessary in reaching the goal to make the website define the Church's Spiritual Mission and a place where visitors and members can visit and get informed about the latest announcements and sermons, local prayer meetings, yearly calendar, and general information e.g. church address and contacts.

**Improvements and Versions**
[Version 1](https://github.com/jerickBilalat/nlcf-website-v1)
[Version 2](https://github.com/jerickBilalat/NLCF-website-v2)

**Next Step:** As of now, the website is in the process of reconstruction in order to make the website from static to dynamic, adding administration and content managment. To accomplish the task, the MEAN stack is used and implemented.
