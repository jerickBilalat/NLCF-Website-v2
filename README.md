## NLCF Church Website version 3
**Goal:**For over two years developing the NLCF website, it has been my largest project because the process of making the static websites and publishing it involved not just coding but also content management, design, and some seo which involves the application of semantic HTML5 tags. All these work are necessary in meeting the goal to make the website define the Church's Spiritual Mission and where visitors and members can visit and get informed about the latest announcements and sermons, local prayer meetings, yearly calendar, and general information e.g. church address and contacts.

**Next Step:** As of now, the website is in the process of complete reconstruction in order to make the website a single page instead of a multi page site without losing contents and overwhelming the user. The reason for the reconstruction is for a more fluid user experience where users will only load one page that displays all information efficiently. To accomplish the task, the use of modals and  AJAX will be the key to load extra contents that are not necessarily needed on the page.
